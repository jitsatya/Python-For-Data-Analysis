### Object Oriented programming in Python
- A different way of writing code
#### The Observation:
- Everything in python is an object
#### Generality to specificity
### Object Oriented programming concepts:
- Objects
- Class
- Polymorphism
- Encapsulation
- Inheritence
- Abstraction

### Class
- Class is a bluprint
- In python: datatype is the class and a variable of that datatype is an object of that class

Class Has two things:
- Data or property (Description of object)
- Function or behaviour

**Class Basic Structure**

    class car:
        color = "blue" # Data
        model = "sport" # Data
    
        def calculate_avg_speed(km,time):
            #some code

- Name of class should be in pascal case: ThisIsPascalCase
- Public methods are available to anyone creating an object of that class
- Data are not accessible from outside
- Object is an instance of the class

Creating Object Examples:
1. Class Car ---- Object WagonR ----- wagonr = Car()
2. Class Sports ---- Object football ---- football = Sports()
3. Class Animals ---- Object Langoor ----- langoor = Animal()

Object Literal - easier way to create object of builtin classes

    L = [] is same as L=list()

**Lets Make a Class**


```python
### Functions Vs Methods - Method is a special function which is written inside of a class
### Functions do not require an object for calling, objects are generally passed as parameter. Example len(L)
### Where as methods are called by using an object of that class. Example: L.append(1)

## Class Example: ATM Machine

class ATM:
    # init is a constructor, code inside this method gets automatically executed when an object is created
    # name of the constructor must be init
    # init or constructor is a magic method, magic methods are predefined, You can't create them
    # Magic methods are not called by Objects, they are called automatically based on some given criteria
    # Users do not have the control of constructor
    def __init__(self):
        print(id(self))
        # self is the object you are currently working with
        # When an method is called by an object by default the object (self) gets passed as a parameter to that method
        # Only an object of a class can access its methods and data, methods and data inside a class can not
        # be accessed by even another method inside the same class.
        # This is why self is always passed as parameter to all the methods
        self.__pin = ""
        self.__balance = 0
        self.__menu()
    def __menu(self):
        user_input = input('''

**Creating Our Own Data Type fraction**


```python
class Fraction:
    def __init__(self, n, d):
        self.num = n
        self.den = d
# magic method __str__(): dicides how an object will be printed, or how an object is visible to others  
    def __str__(self):
        return "{}/{}".format(self.num, self.den)
# magic method __add__(): decides what happens when '+' operand is between two objects of the class
    def __add__(self, other):
        new_num = self.num * other.den + other.num * self.den
        new_den = self.den * other.den
        return "{}/{}".format(new_num, new_den)
# magic method __sub()__: decides what happens when '-' operand is between two objects of the class
    def __sub__(self, other):
        new_num = self.num * other.den - other.num * self.den
        new_den = self.den * other.den
        return "{}/{}".format(new_num, new_den)
# magic method __mul()__: decides what happens when '*' operand is between two objects of the class
    def __mul__(self, other):
        new_num = self.num * other.num
        new_den = self.den * other.den
        return "{}/{}".format(new_num, new_den)
# magic method __truediv()__: decides what happens when '/' operand is between two objects of the class
    def __truediv__(self, other):
        new_num = self.num * other.den
        new_den = self.den * other.num
        return "{}/{}".format(new_num, new_den)
```


```python
a = Fraction(1,3)
b = Fraction(2,5)
print(a)
print(b)
print(a+b) # __add__()
print(a-b) # __sub__()
print(a*b) # __mul__()
print(a/b) # __truediv__()
```

    1/3
    2/5
    11/15
    -1/15
    2/15
    5/6


**Encapsulation**

Encapsulation refers to the bundling of data with the methods that operate (get/set) on that data, or the restricting of direct access to some of an object's components.
- Need for Encaosulation
- Private attributes
- Getter and setter methods
- Class Diagram : class name, data, methods and + for public and - for private


```python
# Instance variable - variables inside constructor or __init__(), 
# value of the variable is different for differnt object
# It is not a good practice to keep your data directly accessible 
# __ is used to make data or method private.
# whenever __data/method is used python internally replaces it by _class__data/method. 
# And if we use __data/method to do anything in our code like sbi.__balance = "ytfyt",
# a new variable will get created but it will not change the actual data of the object
sbi.__balance = "hhhsad"
```


```python
sbi.deposit() # still works as the original balance did not get replaced by string
```

    Please Enter Your PIN: 1234
    Please Enter amount to deposit: 3000
    Deposit Successful



```python
# but if we do this
# sbi._ATM__balance = "ghfv"
# sbi.deposit()
# Will show error as we are changing actual value of the object
# That is why ##Nothing in Python is truely private##, It is a gentle mans language and if there is __ in an attribute
# One should know that it should not be used.
```


```python
# get and set
hdfc = ATM()
```

**Collection of Objects**


```python
class Customer3:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
        
    def intro(self):
        print("I am", self.name, "and my age is", self.age)
        
cust1 = Customer3("Satyajit", 26)
cust2 = Customer3("Kunal", 24)
cust3 = Customer3("Sunil", 25)

L = (cust1, cust2, cust3)

for i in L:
    print(i.name, i.age) # we can run loops on objects
    i.intro()
```

    Kunal 24
    I am Kunal and my age is 24
    Sunil 25
    I am Sunil and my age is 25


**Static**


```python
# Instance variable and Static Variable
# Instance variable is different for each object
# Example: Account number of customers, CGPA of students
# Static variable is same for all objects. 
# Example: IFSC code for customers of a branch, name of degree for a class

class Customer4:    
# static variable is declared outside constructor
    __counter = 1 # static variable can be accessed by class name
    # we can make it private bu using __counter and make getter ans setter and control what can be set as its value
    @staticmethod
    def get_counter(): # these don't need self
        return Customer4.__counter
    @staticmethod
    def set_counter(new_counter):
        if type(new_counter) == int:
            Customer4.__counter = new_counter
        else:
            print("invalid counter")
            
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
        self.sno = Customer4.__counter #Accessing static variable
        Customer4.__counter +=1
        
    def intro(self):
        print("I am", self.name, "and my age is", self.age)
        
cust1 = Customer4("Satyajit", 26)
cust2 = Customer4("Kunal", 24)
cust3 = Customer4("Sunil", 25)

print(cust1.name)
print(cust1.sno, cust2.sno, cust3.sno)
print(cust1.get_counter(), cust2.get_counter(), cust3.get_counter()) # value of static variable is same universally
print(Customer4.get_counter())
cust1.set_counter("hey") # can't set string
cust1.set_counter(56) # Accepts integer
print(cust1.get_counter())
```

**Relationships between classes**
- Aggregation (Has a relationship)
    - Customer has an address
- Inheritence (Is a relationship), 
    - Example: Smartphones is a product
    - Example: Car is a vehicle


```python
#Example: Aggregation
class Cust:
    def __init__(self, name, gender, address):
        self.name = name
        self.gender = gender
        self.address = address

    def edit_profile(self, new_name, new_city, new_pin, new_state):
        self.name = new_name
        self.address.change_address(new_city, new_pin, new_state) # calling function of another class
        
class Address:
    def __init__(self, city, pin_code, state):
        self.city = city
        self.pin_code = pin_code
        self.state = state
        
    def change_address(self, new_city, new_pin, new_state):
        self.city = new_city
        self.pin_code = new_pin
        self.state = new_state
        
add1 = Address("Bangaluru", 70001, "Karnataka")
cust1 = Cust("Satyajit", "Male", add1) # creating object using object of another class

print(cust1.address.city, cust1.address.pin_code, cust1.address.state)

cust1.edit_profile("Satya", "New York", 50001, "New York") # passing arguements to method of one class
# edit variables of another class

print(cust1.address.city, cust1.address.pin_code, cust1.address.state)
```

    Bangaluru 70001 Karnataka
    New York 50001 New York


**Inheritence**
- DRY: Don't repeat Yourself (code)
- Code reusability is the biggest benefit of inheritence
- Inheritence only works downwords, reverse inheritence is not possible
- All data menbers and member functions and the constructor gets inherited
- Private members are not inherited


```python
# Example: Inheritence
class User:
    def login(self):
        print("login")
        
    def register(self):
        print("register")
        
class Student(User): # Student is the subclass of User Class
    def enroll(self):
        print("Enroll")
    
    def review(self):
        print("Review")
        
stu1 = Student()

stu1.enroll()
stu1.login()
stu1.register()
stu1.review()

user1 = User()

#user1.enroll()  #Won't work
user1.login()
user1.register()
#user1.review() #Won't work
```

    Enroll
    login
    register
    Review
    login
    register


Constructor:
- Python will first look for constructor in child class and go to parent class if it can't find any
- If Child has a constructor then parents constructor does not get called, and if inheriting method that uses variables of parent initialized by parents constructor, that method might not work

Prvate Members:
- Object of child class can't access hidden members of parent class 

Super Keyword:
- Super keyword invokes the parents methods and parents constructor, data members can not be accessed using super
- It is useful to call Super keyword on parents constructor as the common attributes can be set that way
- Super constructor should be the first statement in the child constructor.
- We can call parents attributes using self in child class
       
 Example - 

        def __init__(self, a, b, c, d, e):
          
          super().__init__(a, b, c) # Using parents constructor for initialization
          self.d = d
          self.e = e
          
Types of inheritence: 
- Single level inheritence: parent --- child
- Multilevel Inheritence: ---parent --- child --- grand child ----
- Hierarchical inheritence: parent --- child1  /  parent ---- child 2
- Multiple inheritence: parent1 / parent2 ----- child (Multiple inheritence works in puthon):
            - order of invoke (priority) -> child -- first parent -- second parent --- (Method Resolution Order)
            
        SmartPhone(Phone, Product): # This order decides the priority
            pass
            
- Hybrid inheritence: combination of other inheritences

Polymorphism:
- Method overriding: Method of child class will get executed if both the classes have same name for method

- Method overloading: We use default arguements to do method overloading in python
    
- Operator overloading: change the behaviour of operators, It is done using Magic methods


```python
#Example: Method overloading
class Geometry:
    def area(self, radius):
        return 3.14 *radius * radius
    
    def area(self, l, b):
        return l*b

obj = Geometry()
print(obj.area(3,4))
#print(obj.area(4)) # this will not work in python as method gets overridden by another with two required arguements

# We can use default arguements to smartly bypass this

class Geometry1:
    
    def area(self, a, b=0): # setting default value of b to 0
        if b==0:
            print("Area of circle: ", 3.14*a*a)
        else:
            print("Area of rectangle: ", a*b)

obj3 = Geometry1()

obj3.area(23) # circle as only one arguement is passed
obj3.area(23,38) # rectange as two arguements are passed

# Therefore we use default arguements to do method overloading in python
```

    12
    Area of circle:  1661.06
    Area of rectangle:  874
