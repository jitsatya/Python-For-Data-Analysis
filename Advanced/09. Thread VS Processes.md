**Thread VS Processes**

Threads:
- I/O bound tasks
- Share memory of the parent process
- Lesser creation time
- In Pyhton Threads can not run in multiple cores due to Global interpreter lock (GIL) {Runs where the parent thread is}

Process:
- CPU Bound Tasks
- Do not share memory by default
- Greater creation time
- Can run in multiple cores

I/O and CPU bound tasks:

I/O: Network requests, memory requests {Threads should be used as there is no benefit of creating process with greater creation time}

CPU: Image Processing {Processes as they can use multiple cores efficiently}
