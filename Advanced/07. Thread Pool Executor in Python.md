### Thread Pool Executor in Python

Problems with Threading
1. Thread creation time
    - context switch time: time taken to switch from one thread to another
    - thread creation time time taken to create a thread
2. Number of threads
    - more the number of thread less the instruction per clock
3. Threads are non-reusable
    - Dead threads occupy the memory

**Thread Pools:**
- A pool of threads get created when program initializes.
- Threads in the pool known as workers, wait for a task to be assigned to them
- a running thread takes much less time to switch to new task than starting a new thread.
- Once the task of a thread is done, it is returned to the pool and waits for another task (Reuse)
- There are limit on how many workers exist in a pool so, we have control over number of threads executing at the same time


```python
# Submit method
import time
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor, as_completed

start_time = time.time()

def something(id):
    print(id, "Going to Sleep")
    time.sleep(1)
    return "{} Woke Up".format(id)

with ThreadPoolExecutor() as executor:
    task = [executor.submit(something, i) for i in range(10)]
    for _ in as_completed(task):
        print(_.result())

end_time = time.time()

print("Main thread took {} seconds".format(round(end_time - start_time, 4)))
```
