### File Handling in Python
**Agenda**
- Introduction 
- Getting Started
- Concepts
- Practical Approach

**Types of files in Python**
- Binary
- Text

**What is File Handling**
Operations:
- Creating
- Reading
- Updating
- Deletion

**Reading a File**


```python
#Open a file
# Syntax open(filename, mode) modes are Read, Append, Write, Create we can also pass t as text or b as binary
# by default it is text
# Example

# opening file
f = open('demo.txt', 'r') 

# reading the entire file
print(f.read()) 
f.close()

# Reading first 5 characters
f = open('demo.txt', 'r')
print("First 5 characters: ", f.read(5))
f.close()
```

    This is a sample text file used for file handling demonstration
    Another line in the file
    Hey there
    Just Testing
    Are you still there
    Hello world
    First 5 characters:  This 



```python
# Line by line output
f = open('demo.txt', 'r')
print(f.readline())
print(f.readline())
print(f.readline())
f.close()
```

    This is a sample text file used for file handling demonstration
    
    Another line in the file
    
    Hey there
    



```python
# Read lines seperately
f = open('demo.txt', 'r')
print(f.readlines())
f.close()
```

    ['This is a sample text file used for file handling demonstration\n', 'Another line in the file\n', 'Hey there\n', 'Just Testing\n', 'Are you still there\n', 'Hello world']



```python
# Read lines by looping 
file = open('demo.txt', 'r')

for line in file:
    print(file.readline())
    
f.close()
```

    Another line in the file
    
    Just Testing
    
    Hello world


**Write Operation on a file**


```python
# Write operation append and write
# Write mode will erase everything in the file so use wisely
# Append adds text to the existing file
file = open('demo.txt', 'w')
file.write("This is a replaced text \n")
file.write("This is the second line")
file.close()
```

**Creating a File**


```python
# 'x' parameter is used to create a file
file = open('created_file1.txt', 'x')
file.write("This text was written")
file.close()
```

**Deleting a File**


```python
# Deleting a file 
import os

if os.path.exists('demo.txt'): # Checking if the file exists
    os.remove('demo.txt')
else:
    print("File Does not exist")
```

    File Does not exist
