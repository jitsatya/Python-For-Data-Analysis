## Generators in Python

**What is a Generator**

Python generators are a simple way of creating iterators.

**A Simple Example**


```python
def gen_demo(): #Generator is a function which returns Generator Object
    
    yield "first statement"
    yield "second statement"
    yield "third statement" # it uses yield instead of return
    
gen = gen_demo() # we can use __next__() on generator to get all yield

print(gen)

print(next(gen))
print(next(gen))
print(next(gen))
## print(next(gen))

#  We can also use loop in generator object
#  We can not reuse a gen object to yield same result as yield remembers the last execution state and there are no
#  more yields left in gen
gen2 = gen_demo()
for i in gen2:
    print (i)
    
# gen_demo() gets called only when you apply next or loop on items
```

    <generator object gen_demo at 0x7fe5d00ff220>
    first statement
    second statement
    third statement
    first statement
    second statement
    third statement


**Yield Vs Return**

Yield: memorized the previous returned item, we can have multiple yields. In case og yield function gets partially executed and remembers the last execution state

Return: Only one return is allowed to execute per function, once return is executed function is removed from memory


```python
##Example2

def square(num):
    for i in range(num):
        yield i**2
        
gen = square(10)

print(next(gen))
print(next(gen))
print(next(gen))

for i in gen: # Starts printing from the next number as 3 yields already executed and generators remembers the state
    print(i)
```

**Range (Iterator) Function using Generator**


```python
def MyRange(start, end):
    for i in range(start, end):
        yield i
        
for i in MyRange(1,11):
    print(i)
```

**Generator Expression**


```python
import sys
#List Comprehension
L = [i**2 for i in range(1,1000000)]

# for i in L:
#     print(i)
    
#Now see the memory usage of list which is used just for loop
print(sys.getsizeof(L)/1024, "KB")
```

```python
#Generator Expression
gen = (i**2 for i in range(1,1000000))

# for i in gen:
#     print(i)
   
#Now see the memory usage of generator for same loop
print(sys.getsizeof(gen)/1024)
```

**Benefits of Using generators**

1. Ease of implementation
2. Memory efficient
3. Representing infinite stream
4. Chaining generators


```python
#4 example
def fibonacci(nums):
    x,y = 0,1
    for _ in range(nums):
        x,y = y, x+y
        yield x
        
def square(nums):
    for num in nums:
        yield num**2
        
print(sum(square(fibonacci(20)))) #Chaining to make square of each fibonacci output
```
