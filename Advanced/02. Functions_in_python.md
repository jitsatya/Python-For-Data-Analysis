### Functions in Python
Functions are basically blackboxes where we give a valid input to get a desired output.
Principles of Function:
- Abstraction: Hiding the details
- Decomposition: Combining multiple functions to accomplish a bigger goal

Components of a Python Function:
- Def
- Identifier : name
- Arguements : Inputs
- DocString : Manual
- Body : Core Logic
- Return : Output
- Call : Using the function


```python
# Simple Function
def is_even(number):
    '''
    This Function returns if a number is odd or even
    input - an integer
    output - Odd/Even
    Created By - Satyajit
    Date Created - 9th August 2022
    '''
    if type(number) == int:
        if number%2==0:
            return "Even"
        else:
            return "Odd"
    else:
        return "Invalid input"
    
for i in range(4,9):
    print(i, " is ", is_even(i))
    
print(is_even("Satya"))

print(is_even.__doc__) #Looking at the DocString
```

    4  is  Even
    5  is  Odd
    6  is  Even
    7  is  Odd
    8  is  Even
    Invalid input
    
        This Function returns if a number is odd or even
        input - an integer
        output - Odd/Even
        Created By - Satyajit
        Date Created - 9th August 2022
        


The two point of views:
- The one who created the function (More responsibility)
- The one who uses the function

Frame:
- Global - Global objects
- Local - local objects destroys when the function is done executing

return value is none by default

**Parameters Vs Arguements**
Parameters - a input required by function, example: Age
Arguements - Value of that input, example: 26

Types of Arguements:
1. Default Arguements
2. Positional Arguements
3. Keyword Arguements
4. Arbitrary Arguements


```python
#1. Default Arguements
def power(a=1,b=1): # default value of a and b so that the program does not show error when one or both of them are not provided
    return a**b

print(power(4,3)) # Both arguements are provided
print(power(4)) # Only the First Arguement is provided
print(power()) # No arguements are provided
```

    64
    4
    1



```python
#2. Positional Arguements: The order in which the arguements are sent

#3. keyword Arguements: 
print(power(b=3, a=4)) # Overriding positional arguements by explicitly mentioning the keyword and value
```

    64



```python
#4. Arbitrary Arguements: Number of aruements does not matter
def flexi_product(*number): # Flexible parameters
    print("Product of: ", number, type(number)) # Stored in a tuple
    product = 1
    for i in number: # can be Looped over
        product = product *i
    print(product)

flexi_product(8,7,3,4) # Passing multiple arguements
```

    Product of:  (8, 7, 3, 4) <class 'tuple'>

**Global variable and Local Variable**


```python
#Example 1: Local variable are the ones which are created inside function
def func(y):
    x = 50 # Local variable created inside function, gets destroyed when fuction is done executing
    x = x +y
    print(x)
x=100 # Global variable
func(x)
print(x) # Global variable does not change
    
```

    150
    100



```python
# Example 2: If no local variable are created with same name, global variable will be used
def func_1 (y):
    print(x) # prints global variable x as no local variable were created in side function
    print(x+5) # new integer is being created, it does not update the glbal varable
x = 5
func_1(x)
print(x)
```

    5
    10
    5



```python
# Example 3: Can't modify the global variable inside a function
def func_2(y):
    # x=x+1 #Will not work as we are trying to modify a global variable
    m = x+1 # here we are using the global variable
    print(m)
x=5
func_2(x)
print(x)
```

    6
    5



```python
# Example 4: Using global keyword to chamge global variable
def func_3(y):
    global x # Using global keyword
    x +=1 # Now we are able to change the global variable
    print(x)
x=5
func_3(x)
print(x) # The global variable got changed
# This should only be used if there is no other way
```

    6
    6



```python
# Example 5: using global variable passed as parameter
def func_4(x):
    x = x+1 # This x is coming as an input and is not in the global scope, so we are able to make changes to this local variable
    print(x)
x = 5
func_4(x)
print(x) # Global variable remains unchanged
```

**Nested Functions**


```python
#Example 1: Calling nested function inside function
def f():
    print("Inside f")
    def g(): # Nested function
        print("Inside g")
    g() # Calling Nested function
f() #Calling the outer function
```

    Inside f
    Inside g



```python
# Nested functions are hidden (abstracted) from the main program
# if we call outer function from nested function we fall into recursion
# Example 2:

def f(x):
    def g():
        x = 'abc' # new variable x is being created inside the nested function
        print("inside g: ", x)
    x +=1 # using the parameter (local)
    g() 
    print("inside f", x) #
    
    return x
x= 5
f(x)
print(x) # global variable never changes unless global keyword is used
```

    inside g:  abc
    inside f 6
    5



```python
# Example 3:
def f_1(x):
    def g_1(x):
        x = x+1
        print("x inside g_1: ", x)
    x=x+1
    g_1(x)
    print("x inside f_1: ", x)
x = 10
f_1(x)
print("global x: ", x)
```

    x inside g_1:  12
    x inside f_1:  11
    global x:  10


**Everything in Python is an Object**

Functions are objects too

Following can be performed in a function:
- Renaming a function
- Deleting a function
- Storing a function
- Returning a function
- Function as agruement


```python
# Functions as objects
def func_obj(x):
    return x**2
print(func_obj(5))
x = func_obj # Assigning function to a name
print(x(10), type(x)) # Now x is a function itself
```

    25
    100 <class 'function'>



```python
# using function as object in a list
L = [1,2,3,x] # function in a list
print(L)
print(L[3](6)) # using function from a list
L = [1,2,3,x(2)] # passing arguement inside a function in a list
print(L)
```

    [1, 2, 3, <function func_obj at 0x7f320c2e4620>]
    36
    [1, 2, 3, 4]



```python
# using function as return
def f():
    def g(a,b):
        return a*b
    return g # returning function g which requires two arguements
value = f()(4,5) # arguements are passed here
print(value)
```

**Benefits of Functions**
- Code Modularity
- Code Reusability
- Code Readability
