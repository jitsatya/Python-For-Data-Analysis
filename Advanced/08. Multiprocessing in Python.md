### Multiprocessing in Python

What is a Process?
- Some code in execution


```python
import time
import multiprocessing

start_time = time.time()

def something(id):
    print(f"{id}--Going to Sleep")
    time.sleep(1)
    print(f"{id}--Woke Up")

p1 = multiprocessing.Process(target=something, args=(0,))
p1.start()
    
p1.join() # join with main process
end_time = time.time()

print("Main process took {} seconds".format(round(end_time - start_time, 4)))
```

    0--Going to Sleep
    0--Woke Up
    Main process took 1.03 seconds



```python
import os
start_time = time.time()

def something(id):
    print(f" {id}--Going to Sleep its PID is: {os.getpid()}")
    time.sleep(10)
    print(f" {id}--Woke Up")
processes = [multiprocessing.Process(target=something, args=(i,)) for i in range(10)]
    
for process in processes:
    process.start()
    
# join with main process
for process in processes:
    process.join()
    
end_time = time.time()

print("Main process took {} seconds".format(round(end_time - start_time, 4)))
```

     0--Going to Sleep its PID is: 5958
     1--Going to Sleep its PID is: 5959
     2--Going to Sleep its PID is: 5966 3--Going to Sleep its PID is: 5971
    
     5--Going to Sleep its PID is: 5977 6--Going to Sleep its PID is: 5982
    
     4--Going to Sleep its PID is: 5975
     7--Going to Sleep its PID is: 5991
     8--Going to Sleep its PID is: 5994
     9--Going to Sleep its PID is: 6001
     0--Woke Up 1--Woke Up
    
     2--Woke Up
     3--Woke Up
     6--Woke Up 5--Woke Up
     4--Woke Up
    
     7--Woke Up
     8--Woke Up 9--Woke Up
    
    Main process took 10.1598 seconds


**Synchornization**


```python
# Synchornization
balance = 400

def deposit(amount, times):
    global balance
    for _ in range(times):
        balance +=amount
        
def withdraw(amount, times):
    global balance
    for _ in range(times):
        balance -=amount
        
deposit_process = multiprocessing.Process(target=deposit, args= (400, 2000))
withdraw_process = multiprocessing.Process(target=withdraw, args= (400, 200))

deposit_process.start()
withdraw_process.start()

deposit_process.join()
withdraw_process.join()

print(f" Final Balance is: {balance}") 
# It prints original value that is 200 because new memory space gets created when a new process in created
# And the new process does not change the original value

# That is the main difference between processes and threads
## Threads share the memory of their parent Thread
## While processes have their seperate memory
```

     Final Balance is: 400


**Inter Process Communication**
- Shared memory: A memory space is shared by more than one processes
- Message Passing: One process sends a message to the kernel and then the kernel send the message to the other process


```python
# Shared Memory
# Not synchornized

def deposit(amount, times, balance):
    for _ in range(times):
        balance.value +=amount
        
def withdraw(amount, times, balance):
    for _ in range(times):
        balance.value -=amount
        
balance = multiprocessing.Value('i', 400)
deposit_process = multiprocessing.Process(target=deposit, args= (1, 10000, balance))
withdraw_process = multiprocessing.Process(target=withdraw, args= (1, 1000, balance))

deposit_process.start()
withdraw_process.start()

deposit_process.join()
withdraw_process.join()

print(f" Final Balance is: {balance.value}") # Wrong outcome as the processes are not synchornized
```

     Final Balance is: 9393



```python
# Shared Memory
# synchornized using Lock

def deposit(amount, times, balance, lock):
    for _ in range(times):
        lock.acquire()
        balance.value +=amount
        lock.release()
        
def withdraw(amount, times, balance, lock):
    for _ in range(times):
        lock.acquire()
        balance.value -=amount
        lock.release()
        
balance = multiprocessing.Value('i', 400)
lock = multiprocessing.Lock()
deposit_process = multiprocessing.Process(target=deposit, args= (1, 100000, balance, lock))
withdraw_process = multiprocessing.Process(target=withdraw, args= (1, 10000, balance, lock))

deposit_process.start()
withdraw_process.start()

deposit_process.join()
withdraw_process.join()

print(f" Final Balance is: {balance.value}")
```

     Final Balance is: 90400


**Process Pool Executor**


```python
from concurrent.futures import ProcessPoolExecutor, as_completed

def something(id, sleep_time):
    print(f"{id}--Going to Sleep")
    time.sleep(sleep_time)
    return f"{id}--Woke Up"

print("Main Process Starting")
start_time = time.time()
# bound: number of processes running in a particular time is dependent upon number of cores in the processor
with ProcessPoolExecutor() as executor:
    tasks = [executor.submit(something, i, 10-i) for i in range(10)]
    
    for task in as_completed(tasks): #Printed in the orderof completion
        print(task.result())

end_time = time.time()
print("Main process took {} seconds".format(round(end_time - start_time, 4)))
```


```python
#Map method
def something(id, sleep_time):
    print(f"{id}--Going to Sleep")
    time.sleep(sleep_time)
    return f"{id}--Woke Up"

print("Main Process Starting")
start_time = time.time()
ids = [i for i in range(10)]
sleep_time = [i/10 for i in range(10)]
# bound: number of processes running in a particular time is dependent upon number of cores in the processor
with ProcessPoolExecutor() as executor:
    results = executor.map(something, ids, sleep_time)
    
    for result in results: #Printed in the orderof completion
        print(result)

end_time = time.time()
print("Main process took {} seconds".format(round(end_time - start_time, 4)))
```
