### Threading in Python

- Threads are basic units of CPU utilization

How threads are handled by OS
- CPU continuously switches threads, At a point of time CPU executes only one thread


```python
import time

start_time = time.time()
def something(id):
    print(id, "Going to Sleep")
    time.sleep(1)
    print(id, "Woke Up")
    
for _ in range(5):
    something(1)

end_time = time.time()

print("Main thread took {} seconds".format(round(end_time - start_time, 4)))
```

    1 Going to Sleep
    1 Woke Up
    1 Going to Sleep
    1 Woke Up
    1 Going to Sleep
    1 Woke Up
    1 Going to Sleep
    1 Woke Up
    1 Going to Sleep
    1 Woke Up
    Main thread took 5.0127 seconds



```python
import time
import threading as th

start_time = time.time()
def something(id):
    print(id, "Going to Sleep")
    time.sleep(3)
    print(id, "Woke Up")
    
def another_thing(id):
    print(id, "Going to Sleep")
    time.sleep(2)
    print(id, "Woke Up")

# Create the threads
t1 = th.Thread(target = something, args = [0])
t2 = th.Thread(target = another_thing, args = [1])

# Start both the threads at the same time
t1.start()
t2.start()

#Join threads with main thread so that main thread waits for other threads to execute
t1.join()
t2.join()

end_time = time.time()

# Main thread takes less time, time of other threads do not get added as they ran simultenously
print("Main thread took {} seconds".format(round(end_time - start_time, 4))) 
```

    0 Going to Sleep
    1 Going to Sleep
    1 Woke Up
    0 Woke Up
    Main thread took 3.0106 seconds



```python
