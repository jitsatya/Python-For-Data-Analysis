### Strings in python
**Strings are a sequence of Unicode characters**
- Creating Strings
- Accessing Strings
- Adding chars to Strings
- Editing Strings
- Deleting Strings
- Operations on Strings
- String Functions

#### Creating Strings


```python
a= "Hello"
b= 'There,'
c= "It's raining outside"
d= '''This is also allowed, used when there are multiple lines if strings'''
e= str("Good")
print(a,b,c,d, e)
```

    Hello There, It's raining outside This is also allowed, used when there are multiple lines if strings Good


#### Accessing Substrings from a String


```python
c= "hello"
print(c[1]) # positive indexing starts from 0
print(c[-1]) # negative indexing starts from -1
```

    e
    o



```python
#Slicing
c= "Hey There"
print(c[0:3]) # start is the starting postition(zero indexed), end + 1 position as end. Basically [start,end)
print(c[4:]) # get all the chars from 4th indexed char
print(c[:3]) # till 3rd index(not including)
print(c[:]) # all included
print(c[0::2]) # stepped by 2
print(c[::-1]) # reverses the string  
```

    Hey
    There
    Hey
    Hey There
    HyTee
    erehT yeH


#### Editing and deleting Strings


```python
m = "Hey There"
# m[0] = K   -String objects does not support item assignment, Strings are Immutable in python
m = "Hey World" # can be completely reassigned
print(m)
```

    Hey World



```python
#Deletion
del m # can delete the entire string but can not delete characters from string
```

#### String Operations
- Arithmetic Operations
- Relational Operators
- Logical Operators
- Loops on Strings
- Membership Operators


```python
# + and * can be used from artithmetic operations
print("Hello" + " World")
print('booo'*20)
```

    Hello World
    booobooobooobooobooobooobooobooobooobooobooobooobooobooobooobooobooobooobooobooo



```python
#Relational operators
print("Hello" == "World")
print("Hello" != "World")
print("Mumbai">"Pune") # Based on dictionary order
print('Kol' > 'kol') # Small letters comes after capital letters, small>capital
```

    False
    True
    False
    False



```python
# logical operators
# empty string"" is False
#"Non empty" is True
print("Hi" and "There") # True and True = True
print("" and "There") # False and True = False
print("Hi" and "") # True and False = False
print("" or "There") # False or True = True
print("Hi" or "") # True or False = True
print("Hi" or "World") # True or True = True
print(not "World") # not True = False
print(not "") # not False =True
```

    There
    
    
    There
    Hi
    Hi
    False
    True



```python
#Loop
c = "Hey There"
for i in c[2:7:1]:
    print(i)
```

    y
     
    T
    h
    e



```python
# Membership operator
print('h' in c,
      'm' in c,
      'k' in c,
      'z' in c,
      'e' in c)
```

    True False False False True


#### String Functions

Common Functions
- len
- min
- max
- sorted


```python
c= "kolkata"
len(c) #Number of characters
```




    7




```python
print(max(c),
      min(c)) # based on ASCII value
```

    t a



```python
print(sorted(c),
      sorted(c, reverse = True)) #Sorts based on ASCII values, returns a list in ascending order by default
```

    ['a', 'a', 'k', 'k', 'l', 'o', 't'] ['t', 'o', 'l', 'k', 'k', 'a', 'a']


#### Only applicable to Strings
**1. Capitalize/Title/Upper/Lower/Swapcase**


```python
print(c.capitalize(), c) #Capitalize the first character but does not change the original string as strings are immutable
```

    Kolkata kolkata



```python
m = "Today is a very good day"
print(m.title() + " is the title case of: " + m) # Title case, first character of every word is Capitalized
```

    Today Is A Very Good Day is the title case of: Today is a very good day



```python
#Upper, Lower and SwapCase
k = "HeY tHeRe"
print(k.upper())
print(k.lower())
print(k.swapcase())

```

    HEY THERE
    hey there
    hEy ThErE


**2. Count**


```python
rain = "It is raining and I don't have umbrella"
print(rain.count("in")) #Count of substring in a String
```

    2


**3. Find/Index**


```python
print(rain.find("i"),
      rain.find("I"),
      rain.find("u"),
      rain.find("z")) # Finds the position of first occurance of a substring
# -1 substring is not available in the string
```

    3 0 31 -1



```python
print(rain.index("i"),
      rain.index("I"),
      rain.index("u"),
      rain.find("z")) 
# If index() can not find the substring it will show error instead on -1
```

    3 0 31 -1


**4. endswith/startswith**


```python
print(rain.endswith("It"),
      rain.endswith("la"),
      rain.startswith("It"),
      rain.startswith("kjhfd")) # self explanatory
```

    False True True False


**5.format**


```python
print("Hello, I am {} and I am {}".format("Satyajit", 26))
```

    Hello, I am Satyajit and I am 26



```python
print("Hello, I am {1} and I am {0}".format(26, "Satyajit"))
# arguements inside format() are indexed and we can use it to specify the value to fill
print("Hello, I am {name} and I am {age}, My weight is {weight}".format(age = 26, name = "Satyajit", weight = 72))
```

    Hello, I am Satyajit and I am 26
    Hello, I am Satyajit and I am 26, My weight is 72


**6. isalnum/ isalpha/ isdecimal/ isdigit/ isidentifier**


```python
print("FLAT20".isalnum(),
      "FLAT%".isalnum(),
      "FLAT".isalpha(),
      "FLAT20".isalpha(),
      "20".isdigit(),
      "20JK".isdigit(),
      "FLAT 20f".isidentifier(), # is can be used as a valid identifier or not
      "FLAT_20f".isidentifier()
     )
```

    True False True False True False False True


**7. Split**


```python
print("Who is the prime minister of India".split(),
      "Who is the prime minister of India".split("the")) # can specify where to split
```

    ['Who', 'is', 'the', 'prime', 'minister', 'of', 'India'] ['Who is ', ' prime minister of India']


**8. Join**


```python
#Reverse of Join
print(" ".join(['Who', 'is', 'the', 'prime', 'minister', 'of', 'India']),
      "/".join(['Who', 'is', 'the', 'prime', 'minister', 'of', 'India']),
      "-".join(['Who', 'is', 'the', 'prime', 'minister', 'of', 'India']))
```

    Who is the prime minister of India Who/is/the/prime/minister/of/India Who-is-the-prime-minister-of-India


**9. replace**


```python
print("My name is Satyajit".replace("Satyajit", "Jethalal Champak Lal Gada"))
```

    My name is Jethalal Champak Lal Gada


**10. strip**


```python
name = "     Satyajit "
print("Hi " + name,
      "Hi " +name.strip())
```

    Hi      Satyajit  Hi Satyajit
