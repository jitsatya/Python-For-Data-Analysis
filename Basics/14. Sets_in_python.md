### Sets in Python

**Rules of Set**
- Sets do not allow duplicates
- Sets have no indexing / Slicing
- Sets don't allow mutable data types
- Set itself is a mutable data type

**Creating a set**


```python
# create an empty set.
S1 = set() # we have to use set() as {} are by default considered as dictionary
type(S1)
```




    set




```python
S1 = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7}
S2 = {"Hello", 2, 4.6, True}
S3 = {1,1,2,2,3,3} # Duplicates are not allowed
S4 = {(1,2,3), "String"} # Only allows immutable data types, Sets has no indexing it has Hashing
# S5 = {{1,2}, {2,3}} # can not create 2D, 3D , 4D sets as sets are mutable and a set can not have mutable data type inside it

print(S1,
     S2,
     S3,
     S4)
```

    {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7} {True, 2, 4.6, 'Hello'} {1, 2, 3} {'String', (1, 2, 3)}


**Accessing and editing Items**


```python
# S1[0] - Does not support, You can not access items, editing is also not allowed
print(id(S1)) # print id of S1 to see if it remains same when I update it with a list
L = list(S1) # creating list from set
print(L)
L[1] = 100 # putting 100 at index 1 of list
print(L)
S1 = set(L) # setting S1 as a set from that list
print(S1)
print(id(S1)) # ids are different, This is a differnt set than the one printed earlier


```

    140124248123656
    [1, 3, 100, 5, 4, 6, 7]
    [1, 100, 100, 5, 4, 6, 7]
    {1, 4, 100, 5, 6, 7}
    140124248124776


**Adding items**


```python
# Adding item is allowed
S1.add(56)
print(S1, id(S1)) # Memory remains same after adding item, hence it is mutable
```

    {1, 4, 100, 5, 6, 7, 56} 140124248124776


**Deleting items from a set**
- using del
- remove
- pop


```python
del S4 # it will work, entire set can be deleted using del keyword
# del S1[0] - will not work as there is no indexing in set
print(S1)
S1.remove(5) # will work as sets do not allow duplicates and there will be only one item in the set with value 5
print(S1)
S1.pop() # removes the last element based on hashing, in reverse direction here
print(S1)
```

    {1, 4, 100, 5, 6, 7, 56}
    {1, 4, 100, 6, 7, 56}
    {4, 100, 6, 7, 56}


**Set Operations**


```python
# Lets create two new sets
S1 = {1,2,3,4,5,6}
S2 = {5,6,7,8,9,0}
# Arithmetic operations do not work
# S1+S2  - Will not work 
# S1*3  - Will not work
for i in S1:
    print(i) # Looping over set works
    
print(2 in S1) # Membership works
```

    2
    3

    5
    6
    True


**Functions on Set**


```python
# Common Functions
print(len(S1)) # number of elements in S1
print(min(S1)) # smallest value in case of homogenous set
print(max(S1)) # largest value in case of homogenous set
print(sorted(S1)) # sorts and converts it into as list
print(sorted(S1, reverse = True)) # sorts, reverses and converts to a list
```

    1
    6
    [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
    [6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]



```python
print(S1)
print(S2)
```

    {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
    {0, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}



```python
# Functions Specific to Sets
# 1. union
# 2. intersection
# 3. difference
# 4. symmetric difference
# 5. issubset
# 6. issuperset

print(S1.union(S2)) # Union of S1 and S2 - all unique elements from both combined
print(S1.intersection(S2)) # elements common in both sets
print(S1.difference(S2)) # elements in S1 but not in S2
print(S2.difference(S1)) # elements in S2 but not in S1
print(S1.symmetric_difference(S2)) # both differences combined - excludes the intersection
print(S1.issubset(S2)) # is S1 a subset of S2
print(S1.issuperset(S2)) # is S1 a superset of S2
```

    {5, 6}
