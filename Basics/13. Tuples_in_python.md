### Tuples in python
- Create
- Access
- Edit
- Add
- Delete
- Operations
- Functions


```python
T1 = ()
T2 = (1,2,3,4,5)
T3 = ("Hello", 4, 4.5)
T4 = (1, 2,3, (5,6,7))
T9 = (1) # Single item tuples are treated as the datatype of that element and not a tuple
T5 = ("Staring") # Single item tuples are treated as the datatype of that element and not a tuple
T6 = ("Starting",) # To create single item tuple we have to include an , at the end
T7 = tuple("Goa") # tuples breaks elements into individual tuple item
T8 = tuple([1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]) # list to tuple

print(T1)
print(T2)
print(T3)
print(T4)
print(T9)
print(T5)
print(T6)
print(T7)
print(T8)
```

    ()
    (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
    ('Hello', 4, 4.5)
    (1, 2, 3, (5, 6, 7))
    1
    Staring
    ('Starting',)
    ('G', 'o', 'a')
    (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)


#### Access


```python
print(T8[2])
print(T8[:4]) #Exactly same as lists
```

    3
    (1, 2, 3, 4)


#### Edit


```python
# Tuple objects does not support assignment
# Tuples are immutable just like string
```

#### Deleting Tuple


```python
del T1 #Entire tuple can be deleted but you can't delete individual elements
```

#### Operations


```python
print(T2+T3)

print(T3*3) # Arithmentic operations are exactly like lists

for i in T2:
    print(i) # Loops can aslo be used
    
print(1 in T2) #Membership works 
    
```

    (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 'Hello', 4, 4.5)
    ('Hello', 4, 4.5, 'Hello', 4, 4.5, 'Hello', 4, 4.5)
    1
    2
    3
    4
    5
    True


#### Function


```python
print(len(T2))

print(min(T2))

print(max(T2))

print(sorted(T2)) #returns a list

print(sorted(T2, reverse = True))

#Tuples are read-only datatype. Tuples are used in the scenarios where integrity of data is important
