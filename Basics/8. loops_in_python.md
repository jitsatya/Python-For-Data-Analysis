### Loops in python
* While Loop
* For Loop

#### While Loop


```python
# while condition:
#     code

number = int(input("Enter the number: "))

print("Multiplication table of: ",number)
i=1

while i<11:
    print(number, " * ", i, " = ", number*i)
    i+=1
```

    Enter the number: 37
    Multiplication table of:  37
    37  *  1  =  37
    37  *  2  =  74
    37  *  3  =  111
    37  *  4  =  148
    37  *  5  =  185
    37  *  6  =  222
    37  *  7  =  259
    37  *  8  =  296
    37  *  9  =  333
    37  *  10  =  370


##### Guessing Game


```python
import random
```


```python
jackpot = random.randint(1,1000)

guess = int(input("Guess the jackpot number: "))
n_attempt = 0
while guess != jackpot:
    if guess<jackpot:
        print ("Guess Higher")
    else:
        print("Guess Lower")
    guess = int(input("Enter the jackpot number: "))
    n_attempt += 1
print("Guessed correctly!")
print("Number of attempts: ", n_attempt)
```

    Guess the jackpot number: 45
    Guess Higher
    Enter the jackpot number: 400
    Guess Higher
    Enter the jackpot number: 800
    Guess Higher
    Enter the jackpot number: 950
    Guess Lower
    Enter the jackpot number: 900
    Guess Lower
    Enter the jackpot number: 850
    Guess Higher
    Enter the jackpot number: 880
    Guess Higher
    Enter the jackpot number: 890
    Guess Higher
    Enter the jackpot number: 895
    Guess Higher
    Enter the jackpot number: 897
    Guess Higher
    Enter the jackpot number: 898
    Guess Higher
    Enter the jackpot number: 899
    Guessed correctly!
    Number of attempts:  11



```python
# attempt code in a modular way, first implement the core logic and then add features one by one
```

#### For Loop


```python
# range function: generate integers in a given range
print(list(range(1, 11))) # numbers from 1 to 10
print(list(range(6))) #numbers from 0 to 6
print(list(range(1, 11, 3))) # numbers from 1 to 11 stepped by 3
print(list(range(11, 1, -1))) # number 11 to 1
```

    [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
    [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    [1, 4, 7, 10]
    [11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2]



```python
# sequence
# Strings, lists, dictionaries, touples
# for loop iterates over either sequence or range()

list_a = []
list_b = []
# for in range()
for i in range(1,11):
    print(i)

print("\n")
for j in range(1,11, 2):
    print(j)
```

```python
for i in "Kolkata":
    print(i)
    
for i in ["Bro", "Sis", "Mom", "Dad"]:
    print (i)
```

    K

- Use for loop when number of iteration is known
- Use while loop when number of iteration is not known

#### Nested Loop


```python
# *
# **
# ***
# ****
# *****

n_rows = int(input("Enter the number of rows: "))

for i in range (1, n_rows +1):
    for j in range(0, i):
        print("*", end = " ")
    print("")
```

    Enter the number of rows: 6
    * 
    * * 
    * * * 
    * * * * 
    * * * * * 
    * * * * * *
